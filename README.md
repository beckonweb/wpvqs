# WordPress Visual Quickstart Guide Theme
Learn to build a theme!

This is the starter theme we built using the tutorials in the WordPress Visual Quickstart Guide. If you're playing along at home, download the initial sync to get the version from the book. 

We'll be updating the site to use the newest WordPress features and documenting the process on the wpvqs webside (http://www.wpvisualquickstart.com).
